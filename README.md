# AsterHunter
We aim to create an automated asteroid hunting and reporting using RaspberryPi, INDI drivers and a Cloud infrastructure. Users will be able to automatically scan a portion of the Celestial Sphere with his/her telescope, upload pictures and results, report abnormalities and inform other users through a Cloud platform. Future implementations could also be characterized with a tracking of a celestial body and lots of amateur pictures :)
